# Resque::UniqueByArity

Because some jobs have parameters that you do not want to consider for determination of uniqueness.

NOTE:

Requires `resque_solo` gem, and `resque-unique_by_arity` gem; the latter is a fork of `resque-lonely_job`.
Why? `resque-lonely_job` and `resque_solo` can't be used together, because their `redis_key` methods conflict.

## Important Note

See `lib/resque/unique_by_arity/configuration.rb` for all config options.  Only a smattering of what is available is documented in this README.

## Most Important Note

You must configure this gem *after* you define the perform class method in your job or an error will be raised thanks to `perform` not having been defined yet.

Example:

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    lock_after_execution_period: 60,
    runtime_lock_timeout: 60 * 60 * 24 * 5, # 5 days
    unique_at_runtime: true,
    unique_in_queue: true
  )
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'resque-unique_by_arity'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install resque-unique_by_arity

## Usage

### Arity For Uniqueness

Some jobs have parameters that you do not want to consider for determination of uniqueness.  Resque jobs should use simple parameters, **not named parameters**, so you can just specify the number of parameters, counting from the left, you want to be considered for uniqueness.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(my, cat, is, the, best, opts = {})
    # Only the first 3: [my, cat, is] will be considered for determination of uniqueness
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 3,
    unique_at_runtime: true
  )
end
```

#### Arity For Uniqueness Validation

Want this gem to tell you when it is misconfigured?  It can.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(my, cat, opts = {})
    # Because the third argument is optional the arity valdiation will not approve.
    # Arguments to be considered for uniqueness should be required arguments.
    # The warning log might look like:
    # 
    #    MyJob.perform has the following required parameters: [:my, :cat], which is not enough to satisfy the configured arity_for_uniqueness of 3
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 3,
    arity_validation: :warning, # or :skip, :error, or an error class to be raised, e.g. RuntimeError
    unique_at_runtime: true
  )
end
```


### Lock After Execution

Give the job a break after it finishes running, and don't allow another of the same, with matching args @ configured arity, to start within X seconds.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    lock_after_execution_period: 60,
    unique_at_runtime: true
  )
end
```

### Runtime Lock Timeout

If runtime lock keys get stale, they will expire on their own after some period.  You can set the expiration period on a per class basis.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    runtime_lock_timeout: 60 * 60 * 24 * 5, # 5 days
    unique_at_runtime: true
  )
end
```

### Unique At Runtime (across all queues)

Prevent your app from running a job that is already running.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    unique_at_runtime: true
  )
end
```

#### Oops, I have stale runtime uniqueness keys for MyJob stored in Redis...
 
Preventing jobs with matching signatures from running, and they never get
dequeued because there is no actual corresponding job to dequeue.

*How to deal?*

```ruby
MyJob.purge_unique_at_runtime_redis_keys
```

### Unique At Queue Time

#### Unique In Job's Specific Queue

Prevent your app from queueing a job that is already queued in the same queue.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    unique_in_queue: true
  )
end
```

#### Unique Across All Queues

Prevent your app from queueing a job that is already queued in *any* queue.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    unique_across_queues: true
  )
end
```

#### Oops, I have stale Queue Time uniqueness keys...
 
Preventing jobs with matching signatures from being queued, and they never get
dequeued because there is no actual corresponding job to dequeue.

*How to deal?*

Option: Rampage

```ruby
# Delete *all* queued jobs in the queue, and
#   delete *all* unqueness keys for the queue.
Redis.remove_queue('queue_name')
```

Option: Butterfly

```ruby
# Delete *no* queued jobs at all, and
#   delete *all* unqueness keys for the queue (might then allow duplicates).
Resque::UniqueInQueue::Queue.cleanup('queue_name')
```

### All Together Now

#### Unique At Runtime (across all queues) AND Unique In Job's Specific Queue

Prevent your app from running a job that is already running, **and**
prevent your app from queueing a job that is already queued in the same queue.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    unique_at_runtime: true,
    runtime_lock_timeout: 60 * 60 * 24 * 5, # 5 days
    unique_in_queue: true
  )
end
```

#### Unique At Runtime (across all queues) AND Unique Across All Queues

Prevent your app from running a job that is already running, **and**
prevent your app from queueing a job that is already queued in *any* queue.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    arity_for_uniqueness: 1,
    unique_at_runtime: true,
    runtime_lock_timeout: 60 * 60 * 24 * 5, # 5 days
    unique_across_queues: true
  )
end
```

### Debugging

Run your worker with `RESQUE_DEBUG=true` to see payloads printed before they are used to determine uniqueness, as well as a lot of other debugging output.

### Customize Unique Keys Per Job

Redefine methods to customize all the things.  Warning: This might be crazy-making.

```ruby
class MyJob
  def self.perform(arg1)
    # do stuff
  end
  include UniqueByArity::Cop.new(
    #...
  )

  # Core hashing algorithm for a job used for *all 3 types* of uniqueness 
  # @return [Array<String, arguments>], where the string is the unique digest, and arguments are the specific args that were used to calculate the digest 
  def self.redis_unique_hash(payload)
    modulizer.rb
    #       for how the built-in version works
    # uniqueness_args = payload["args"] # over simplified & ignoring arity
    # args = { class: job, args: uniqueness_args }
    # return [Digest::MD5.hexdigest(Resque.encode(args)), uniqueness_args]
  end

  unique_in_queue
  def self.solo_redis_key_prefix
    # "unique_job:#{self}" # <= default value
  end

  unique_in_queue
  def self.solo_key_namespace(queue = nil)
    # definition depends on which type of uniqueness is chosen, be careful if you customize
    # "r-uiq:queue:#{queue}:job" # <= is for unique within queue at queue time
    # "r-uiq:across_queues:job" # <= is for unique across all queues at queue time
  end
  
  def self.unique_at_queue_time_redis_key(queue, payload)
    # unique_hash, _args_for_uniqueness = redis_unique_hash(payload)
    # "#{solo_key_namespace(queue)}:#{solo_redis_key_prefix}:#{unique_hash}"
  end
  
  def self.runtime_key_namespace
    # "unique_at_runtime:#{self}"
  end
  
  def self.unique_at_runtime_redis_key(*args)
    # unique_hash, _args_for_uniqueness = redis_unique_hash({"class" => self.to_s, "args" => args})
    # key = "#{runtime_key_namespace}:#{unique_hash}" # <= simplified default
  end
end
```
